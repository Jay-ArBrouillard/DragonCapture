Objective: Players must grab the dragon and bring him to your opponents goal. Prevent the villain from scoring. You can "destroy" the villain by grabbing a green boost and ramming into them while you are in a boosted mode. The first player to outscore the other by 3 goals is the winner.
Move around using A, W, S, D
Spacebar to pick up the rock while you're touching it, then f to throw the rock in the direction your character is facing.
Pause the game with P
Restart the game with Spacebar after game ends.
